I currently work on developing responsible AI tools in open source and Azure Machine Learning. In my spare time I like to write. Some of my writing samples can be found at [Some Simplistic Thinking](https://somesimplisticthinking.blogspot.com/).

Some of the other technical articles that I have contributed on Github are below:-

- [Optimizing pytest runtime](https://github.com/gaugup/PythonPLResources/blob/main/OptimizingPytestRuntime/OptimizingPytestRuntime.md)
- [Different ways of getting python version](https://github.com/gaugup/PythonPLResources/blob/main/WaysToGetPythonVersion/WaysToGetPythonVersion.md)
