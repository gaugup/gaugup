I currently work on developing responsible AI tools in open source and Azure Machine Learning. In my spare time I like to write. Some of my writing samples can be found at [Some Simplistic Thinking](https://somesimplisticthinking.blogspot.com/).

Some of the other technical articles that I have contributed on Github are below:-

- [Optimizing pytest runtime](https://ggupta2005.hashnode.dev/optimizing-test-runtime-using-pytest)
- [Different ways of getting python version](https://ggupta2005.hashnode.dev/different-ways-of-getting-local-python-version)
- [Bootstrap Github workflows for your python project](https://ggupta2005.hashnode.dev/bootstrap-github-workflows-for-your-python-project)
